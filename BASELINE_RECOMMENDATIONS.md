# üéØ Recommended Baselines for Workflow Search Comparison

## Current Baseline

‚úÖ **Parallel PPO (No Workflow)** - `train_parallel_baseline.py`
- Standard PPO with full action space
- No workflow conditioning
- 200 parallel workers

---

## Recommended Additional Baselines

### **1. Random Policy** ‚≠ê (MUST HAVE)

**What:** Agent selects actions uniformly at random

**Why important:**
- Lower bound on performance
- Shows if learning is happening at all
- Easiest to implement
- Standard in all RL papers

**Expected performance:** Very poor (-1000 to -800 avg reward)

---

### **2. Fixed Priority Baselines** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

**What:** Agent always follows a predefined workflow order

**Variants:**
- **Critical-first**: defender ‚Üí op_server ‚Üí enterprise ‚Üí op_host ‚Üí user
- **Enterprise-focus**: enterprise ‚Üí defender ‚Üí op_server ‚Üí op_host ‚Üí user
- **User-priority**: user ‚Üí defender ‚Üí enterprise ‚Üí op_server ‚Üí op_host

**Why important:**
- Shows value of LEARNING the workflow vs using a FIXED one
- Tests if GP-UCB actually finds better workflows than hand-picked
- Shows value of adaptive policy

**Expected performance:** 
- Some fixed orders: -200 to -100 (if lucky, good order)
- Some fixed orders: -400 to -300 (if unlucky, bad order)

---

### **3. Greedy Heuristic Policy** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (VERY IMPORTANT)

**What:** At each step, always fix the highest-priority currently-compromised host

**Logic:**
```
1. Check which hosts are compromised
2. Find highest-priority type in workflow order
3. Execute restore action for that type
4. Repeat
```

**Why important:**
- This is essentially what we WANT the RL agent to learn!
- Shows if RL can match a simple heuristic
- Tests if compliance-based training actually works
- Strong baseline (should be hard to beat)

**Expected performance:** 
- Should achieve 100% compliance by design
- Reward: -150 to -50 (very good!)
- May be hard for RL to beat

---

### **4. A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)** ‚≠ê (Optional)

**What:** Simpler RL algorithm than PPO

**Why important:**
- Different RL algorithm for comparison
- Shows if PPO is necessary
- Faster to train (simpler updates)

**Expected performance:** Similar to PPO but less stable

---

### **5. DQN (Deep Q-Network)** (Optional)

**What:** Value-based RL (vs policy-based PPO)

**Why important:**
- Different RL paradigm
- Popular baseline
- Shows policy gradient vs value-based

**Expected performance:** May struggle with 145 actions

## üéØ Priority Ranking

### **Must Have (for any paper):**
1. ‚úÖ **PPO Baseline** (already have)
2. ‚≠ê **Random Policy** (5 minutes to implement)
3. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Greedy Heuristic** (30 minutes to implement)
4. ‚≠ê‚≠ê **Fixed Priority Baselines** (20 minutes to implement)

### **Nice to Have:**
5. A2C (1 hour to implement)
6. DQN (2 hours to implement)

## üìä Comparison Matrix

| Baseline | Learning? | Workflow? | Compliance? | Expected Reward | Implementation Time |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Random** | No | No | ~20% | -1000 | 5 min |
| **Fixed Priority** | No | Yes | 100% | -200 to -400 | 20 min |
| **Greedy Heuristic** | No | Yes | 100% | -50 to -150 | 30 min |
| **PPO Baseline** | Yes | No | ~30% | -20 to -50 | ‚úÖ Done |
| **A2C** | Yes | No | ~30% | -30 to -70 | 1 hour |
| **Workflow Search (yours)** | Yes | Yes | 90%+ | -10 to 0 (best!) | ‚úÖ Done |

## üî¨ What Each Baseline Tests

### **Random:**
- Tests: Is any learning happening?
- Shows: Lower bound

### **Fixed Priority:**
- Tests: Is learning better than fixed strategy?
- Shows: Value of adaptivity

### **Greedy Heuristic:**
- Tests: Can RL match the "obvious" solution?
- Shows: Whether RL adds value beyond heuristics

### **PPO Baseline:**
- Tests: Value of workflow conditioning
- Shows: Whether workflow structure helps

### **Workflow Search (Your Method):**
- Tests: Best possible performance
- Shows: Value of GP-UCB + compliance training

## üí° Recommended Minimal Set

For a strong paper, implement:

1. ‚úÖ **Workflow Search PPO** (your method)
2. ‚úÖ **Parallel PPO Baseline** (already done)
3. ‚≠ê **Random Policy** (trivial, but necessary)
4. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Greedy Heuristic** (strongest baseline)
5. ‚≠ê‚≠ê **3 Fixed Priority Workflows** (show GP finds better)

**Total: 6 baselines** (1 hour of implementation)

This gives you:
- Lower bound (Random)
- Fixed strategy (Fixed Priority)
- Smart heuristic (Greedy)
- Learning without workflow (PPO Baseline)
- Learning with workflow (Your method)

Perfect for demonstrating the value of your approach! üéØ

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

I can implement these in order:

### **Phase 1 (Critical):**
1. Random Policy (5 min)
2. Greedy Heuristic (30 min)
3. Fixed Priority √ó 3 (20 min)

### **Phase 2 (Optional):**
4. A2C (1 hour)
5. DQN (2 hours)

**Should I start implementing the Phase 1 baselines?**
