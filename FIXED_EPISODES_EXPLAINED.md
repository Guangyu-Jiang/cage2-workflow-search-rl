# üìã Fixed-Episodes Training - What It Actually Does

## Clarification

The fixed-episodes version is **NOT** a baseline without compliance - it's an **ablation study** that tests the value of adaptive termination!

---

## What It Keeps vs Removes

### **‚úÖ KEEPS (Same as Main Method):**

1. **Compliance rewards**
   ```python
   alignment_bonus = alignment_lambda √ó compliance_rate
                   = 30.0 √ó 0.75
                   = 22.5
   
   total_reward = env_reward + alignment_bonus
   ```

2. **Compliance calculation**
   - Checks which hosts are compromised
   - Determines highest-priority compromised type
   - Tracks if fixes target highest priority

3. **Network architecture**
   - Input: [State + Workflow] = 77 dims
   - Same Actor-Critic structure

4. **GP-UCB search**
   - Evaluates all 120 workflows
   - Selects based on UCB

### **‚ùå REMOVES (Key Difference):**

1. **Compliance-based early stopping**
   ```python
   # Main method:
   if compliance >= 0.90:
       break  # Stop early!
   
   # Fixed-episodes:
   # (No early stopping)
   ```

2. **Plateau detection**
   ```python
   # Main method:
   if no_improvement_for_12_updates:
       break  # Stop if stuck!
   
   # Fixed-episodes:
   # (No plateau detection)
   ```

3. **Variable training length**
   ```python
   # Main method:
   # Some workflows: 500 episodes (if they reach 90% fast)
   # Some workflows: 5000 episodes (if they plateau)
   
   # Fixed-episodes:
   # All workflows: 2500 episodes (exactly)
   ```

## Training Flow Comparison

### **Main Method (Adaptive Termination):**

```
Workflow A:
  Update 1: 200 eps, compliance 35%  (continue)
  Update 2: 400 eps, compliance 45%  (continue)
  Update 3: 600 eps, compliance 55%  (continue)
  ...
  Update 10: 2000 eps, compliance 91%  (STOP! ‚úì reached 90%)
  
  Episodes used: 2000

Workflow B:
  Update 1: 200 eps, compliance 28%  (continue)
  Update 2: 400 eps, compliance 35%  (continue)
  ...
  Update 25: 5000 eps, compliance 78%  (STOP! ‚ö†Ô∏è plateau)
  
  Episodes used: 5000
```

### **Fixed-Episodes (This Script):**

```
Workflow A:
  Update 1: 50 eps, compliance 35%   (continue)
  Update 2: 100 eps, compliance 45%  (continue)
  ...
  Update 10: 500 eps, compliance 91% (continue! ‚Üê No early stop)
  ...
  Update 50: 2500 eps, compliance 95% (STOP - fixed limit reached)
  
  Episodes used: 2500 (always)

Workflow B:
  Update 1: 50 eps, compliance 28%   (continue)
  Update 2: 100 eps, compliance 35%  (continue)
  ...
  Update 50: 2500 eps, compliance 78% (STOP - fixed limit reached)
  
  Episodes used: 2500 (always)
```

## What This Tests

### **Research Question:**

**"Does adaptive termination (early stopping at 90% + plateau detection) improve training efficiency?"**

### **Hypothesis:**

Adaptive termination should:
1. **Save episodes** on easy workflows (stop at 500-1000 instead of 2500)
2. **Prevent wasted training** on hard workflows (stop at plateau instead of continuing)
3. **Use episode budget more efficiently** (try more workflows)

### **Comparison:**

| Metric | Adaptive Termination | Fixed Episodes |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Episodes/workflow** | Variable (500-5000) | Fixed (2500) |
| **Easy workflows** | 500-1000 eps | 2500 eps (wasted!) |
| **Hard workflows** | 5000 eps (plateau) | 2500 eps (insufficient!) |
| **Workflows explored** | ~100-200 (variable) | ~40 (100k/2500) |
| **Episode efficiency** | High | Low |

## Expected Results

### **Adaptive Termination (Main Method):**
```
100,000 episode budget:
  - Workflow 1: 800 eps ‚Üí 92% compliance ‚úì
  - Workflow 2: 1200 eps ‚Üí 91% compliance ‚úì
  - Workflow 3: 5000 eps ‚Üí 78% compliance (plateau)
  - Workflow 4: 600 eps ‚Üí 93% compliance ‚úì
  ...
  - Total workflows: ~150
  - Workflows @ 90%: ~100 (67%)
```

### **Fixed Episodes (Ablation):**
```
100,000 episode budget:
  - Workflow 1: 2500 eps ‚Üí 95% compliance (overtrained)
  - Workflow 2: 2500 eps ‚Üí 94% compliance (overtrained)
  - Workflow 3: 2500 eps ‚Üí 78% compliance (undertrained)
  - Workflow 4: 2500 eps ‚Üí 96% compliance (overtrained)
  ...
  - Total workflows: ~40 (100k/2500)
  - Workflows @ 90%: ~25 (62%)
```

**Adaptive should explore MORE workflows with same budget!**

---

## What Makes Them Identical (Important!)

### **Both have:**
- ‚úÖ Compliance rewards (env + lambda √ó compliance)
- ‚úÖ Workflow conditioning
- ‚úÖ GP-UCB search
- ‚úÖ Same network architecture
- ‚úÖ Same PPO hyperparameters
- ‚úÖ Same parallelization (50 workers)

### **Only difference:**
- **Termination rule:** Adaptive (stop at 90%) vs Fixed (always 2500 eps)

## How to Run

```bash
# Adaptive termination (main method)
bash run_executor_async_training.sh

# Fixed episodes (ablation)
bash run_fixed_episodes_training.sh
```

---

## Analysis

After running both, compare:

```python
# Efficiency
adaptive_workflows = len(adaptive_gp_log)
fixed_workflows = len(fixed_gp_log)
print(f"Workflows explored: {adaptive_workflows} vs {fixed_workflows}")

# Compliance distribution
adaptive_compliances = adaptive_gp_log['Final_Compliance']
fixed_compliances = fixed_gp_log['Final_Compliance']
print(f"Avg compliance: {adaptive_compliances.mean():.1%} vs {fixed_compliances.mean():.1%}")

# Episode usage
adaptive_episodes = adaptive_gp_log['Episodes_Trained'].mean()
fixed_episodes = fixed_gp_log['Episodes_Trained'].mean()
print(f"Avg episodes/workflow: {adaptive_episodes:.0f} vs {fixed_episodes:.0f}")
```

**Expected:** Adaptive explores 3-4x more workflows with better final results.

## üéØ Summary

**Fixed-Episodes version:**
- ‚úÖ Uses compliance rewards (tests adaptive termination, not compliance rewards)
- ‚ùå No early stopping (trains exactly 2500 episodes always)
- Tests: "Is adaptive early stopping better than fixed training?"

**Hypothesis:** Adaptive termination is more sample-efficient (explores more workflows, achieves higher avg compliance)

This is the correct ablation to show value of your adaptive stopping strategy! üéØ
