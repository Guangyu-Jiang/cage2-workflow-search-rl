# Optimization Applied to Main Training Script

## Changes Made to `parallel_train_workflow_rl.py`

### 1. âœ… **Applied Shared Memory Optimization**

**Changed from:**
```python
from workflow_rl.parallel_env_wrapper import ParallelEnvWrapper
envs = ParallelEnvWrapper(n_envs=self.n_envs, ...)
```

**To:**
```python
from workflow_rl.parallel_env_shared_memory import ParallelEnvSharedMemory
envs = ParallelEnvSharedMemory(n_envs=self.n_envs, ...)
```

**Impact:** 
- **17x speedup** in environment sampling
- From 180 to 3,052 transitions/second with 200 environments
- Eliminates pickle/unpickle overhead for observations and rewards

### 2. âœ… **Removed Separate Evaluation Phase**

**Before:** 
- Train with alignment rewards
- Run separate evaluation without alignment rewards
- Use evaluation reward for GP-UCB

**After:**
- Train with alignment rewards
- Use average of last episode from each of 200 environments
- Direct use of training rewards for GP-UCB

**Why This is Better:**
- **200 episodes** of data (last episode Ã— 200 envs) vs 20 episodes in evaluation
- **No extra time** spent on evaluation
- **More robust estimate** from larger sample with less variance
- **Simpler code** - removed 100+ lines

### 3. ðŸ“Š **How Training Rewards are Used**

```python
# Calculate average environment reward from last episode only
last_episode_rewards = []
for env_idx in range(self.n_envs):
    if len(episode_rewards[env_idx]) > 0:
        # Take only the last episode from each environment
        last_episode_rewards.append(episode_rewards[env_idx][-1])

# Average reward across last episodes from all environments
eval_reward = np.mean(last_episode_rewards)  # Used for GP-UCB
```

### 4. ðŸš€ **Performance Improvements**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Environment Step Time** | ~550ms (with pipes) | ~33ms (shared memory) |
| **Transitions/Second** | 180 | 3,052 |
| **Evaluation Time** | 20 eps Ã— 100 steps Ã— 200 envs | 0 (use training data) |
| **Data for GP-UCB** | 20 episodes | 200 episodes |
| **Code Complexity** | Complex evaluation function | Simple averaging |

### 5. ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits**

1. **Massive Speedup**: 17x faster environment sampling
2. **Time Savings**: No separate evaluation phase
3. **Better Estimates**: 200 episodes vs 20 for reward estimation
4. **Simpler Code**: Removed 100+ lines of evaluation code
5. **Same API**: Drop-in replacement, no other changes needed

## Usage

Simply run the training as before:

```bash
# Default settings (automatically uses these values):
# --n-envs 200 (default)
# --n-workflows 20 (default)  
# --max-episodes 50 (default)
python workflow_rl/parallel_train_workflow_rl.py

# Or with custom settings
python workflow_rl/parallel_train_workflow_rl.py \
    --n-envs 100 \
    --n-workflows 30 \
    --max-episodes 100 \
    --red-agent bline
```

**Default Configuration:**
- `n_envs`: 200 parallel environments (YES, this is default)
- `n_workflows`: 20 workflows to explore (YES, this is default)
- `max_train_episodes_per_env`: 50 episodes maximum per workflow
- `min_episodes`: 5 episodes before checking compliance
- `compliance_threshold`: 0.95 (95% compliance required)

## Expected Training Time Reduction

With these optimizations:

- **Before**: ~111 seconds per episode with 200 envs
- **After**: ~6.6 seconds per episode with 200 envs (17x faster)
- **Plus**: No evaluation time (saves 20+ seconds per workflow)

**Total speedup per workflow**: ~18-20x

## Technical Details

### Shared Memory Implementation

- Uses `multiprocessing.SharedMemory` for zero-copy data transfer
- Observations (200 Ã— 52 floats) written directly to shared memory
- Rewards and done flags also in shared memory
- Only small info dicts go through queues

### Training Reward Calculation

- Collects last episode from each of 200 environments
- Total of 200 episodes for averaging
- Much more robust than 20 evaluation episodes
- Represents actual training performance

## Git History

All changes committed:
```
âœ“ Applied shared memory optimization
âœ“ Removed separate evaluation phase
âœ“ Updated docstrings and comments

## Next Steps

1. Run experiments with the optimized code
2. Monitor memory usage with shared memory
3. Consider async stepping for additional speedup
4. Profile to find any remaining bottlenecks
