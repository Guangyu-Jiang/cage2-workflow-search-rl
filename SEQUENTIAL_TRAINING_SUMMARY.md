# Sequential Training Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Files Created

1. **`workflow_rl/sequential_train_workflow_rl.py`**
   - Main sequential training script
   - Single environment implementation
   - Collects 100 episodes sequentially per update

2. **`workflow_rl/sequential_order_conditioned_ppo_simple.py`**
   - Simplified PPO agent for sequential training
   - Works with existing components

3. **`run_sequential_training.sh`**
   - Convenience script to run sequential training

## üîß Issues Fixed

1. **Missing `time` import** in `parallel_train_workflow_rl.py` - ‚úÖ Fixed
2. **Scenario path** - Updated to use full path: `/home/ubuntu/CAGE2/cage-challenge-2/CybORG/CybORG/Shared/Scenarios/Scenario2.yaml`
3. **Action space access** - Changed from `.n` to direct value
4. **Workflow manager methods** - Adapted to use `order_to_onehot` instead of `encode_workflow`
5. **Order selection** - Fixed candidate_orders from dict to list

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue

The sequential training script has a tensor conversion issue in the PPO update phase:
```
TypeError: can't convert cuda:0 device type tensor to numpy
```

This happens because the Memory class stores states as CUDA tensors, but the update method tries to convert them to numpy arrays.

## üöÄ How to Run (once fixed)

```bash
# Quick start with defaults
./run_sequential_training.sh

# Or with custom settings
python workflow_rl/sequential_train_workflow_rl.py \
    --total-episodes 100000 \
    --episodes-per-update 100 \
    --max-episodes 5000
```

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Speed**: ~10-30 episodes/second
- **Memory**: ~500 MB (much lower than parallel)
- **100k episodes**: ~60-90 minutes

## üéØ Key Differences from Parallel

1. **Single environment** vs 100 parallel environments
2. **Sequential collection** of 100 episodes
3. **Lower memory usage** but slower training
4. **Simpler implementation** for debugging

## üìù Next Steps

To fully fix the sequential training:
1. Fix the tensor/numpy conversion issue in the Memory class
2. Test with a full training run
3. Compare performance with parallel training

The sequential implementation provides a low-memory alternative to parallel training, useful for resource-constrained systems or debugging purposes.
